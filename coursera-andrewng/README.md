## TODO

### Doubts and extra study

- Contour plots
- Linear Algebra ( derivation )
- Convex / Bowl shaped function
- Squared difference function - why?
- Non invertible matrices due to dependant equations - why?
- Normal equation derivation
- Logistic function/ Sigmoid function (Week 3 logistic regression)
- Why ignore first theta value in regularized logistic regression?
- Digit classification problem (learn more) (neural networks)

### Course extra material
