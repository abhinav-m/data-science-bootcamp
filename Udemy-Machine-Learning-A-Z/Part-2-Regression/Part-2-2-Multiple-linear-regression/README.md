# Summary

## Dummy Variable trap
> When adding dummy variables to the data set, for eg categorical variables of country / state etc. It must be made sure that the dummy variables don't overlap each other. (For n number of dummy variables in a category of a set, n-1 must be included while modelling). This is because if we have 2 countries, and dummy variable D1, D2 = 1 - D1. Therefore only D1 needs to be included. This needs to be done for ALL sets of dummy variables in the dataset.
