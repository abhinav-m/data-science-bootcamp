# Introduction

> Most common languages for prototyping : Octave, python , matlab(paid) , R


## List of commands:


### Variables

* Exponentiation `x<sup>^2</sup>`
* Not equal `x~= 2`
* % - comment
* XOR operation - `xor(1,0)`
* a = 3 -> Prints out output a = 3; -> doesn't print out.
* disp(a) -> more complex printing
* disp(sprintf('2 decimals: %0.2f',a)) Change 0.2f value to change decimal places
* format long -> large number of decimal places format short -> short

### Vectors and matrices

* Matrix declaration A = [1 2;3 4;5 6;] or A = [1 2;
  3 4;
  5 6] 3 x 2 matrix
* v = [1; 2; 3] 1 X 3 Vector Row vector
* v= [1 2 3]  Vector Column vector
* Dynamic initialization v = 1:0.5:6 -> Vector with column ranging from 1 -> 6 with 0.5 as step
* v = 1:6  vector with columns 1->6 with 1 as step
* ones(3,5) -> Generates matrices of ones of 3,5 size
* zeros(1,3) -> Generates matrices of zeros 1,3 size
* w = rand(1,3) -> Generates matrices of random numbers (between  0 and 1
* w = randn (1,5) -> Generates random matrices of gaussian distribution ( bell shaped curve)
* hist -> to draw histogram for the data
* eye -> Identity matrice eye(4) -> 4X4 Identity matrix
