# Selecting features and applying polynomial regression

In the housing prices problem, with two parameters length and breadth of the house, a better solution to reduce it to one feature can be to calculate the area of the house.

This reduces our hypothesis to one parameter and makes calculations easier.

## Polynomial regression
To change the shape of the curve of our hypothesis function we can make it into a polynomial function ie, quadratic, cubic or square root function.

> If squared/ cubed  or rooted , feature scaling becomes very important and must be calculated appropriately.
