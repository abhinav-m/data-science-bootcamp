# Dimensionality - reduction - motivation: Data Visualization

> Visualization of dataset is a key part of data oriented problems. Visualizing the data can help understand the main factors which affect the data, and helps in the decision making process.

Dimensionality reduction helps in visualizing the data by reducing it to a 2d or 3d data set which can be easily visualized and thought upon.

Suppose we have a feature vector of 50 dimensions for a dataset of countries. This could include GDP, Human development index, poverty index, etc. 

By reducing this to a two dimension vector z and plotting for z1 and z2, a visualization can be obtained where the x dimension ( roughly ) correlates to the countries size / GDP , and the y dimension is a measure of the companies GDP per person. This can help capture the main dimensions of a dataset, and help visualize and work on the data better.
