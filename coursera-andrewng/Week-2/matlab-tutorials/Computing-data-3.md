# Computing data

> `.` represents element wise operations
* A . *B = Multiply elements of A by B
* A . ^2 = Element wise squaring of A
* 1 ./ v = Element wise reciprocal of V
* log(V) element wise log, abs(v) element wise absolute value
* -V  = -1 * v (Negates matrix)
* v + ones(length(v) ,1) -> Add one to each element of vector v or simply v + 1 ( add one to each element of v)
