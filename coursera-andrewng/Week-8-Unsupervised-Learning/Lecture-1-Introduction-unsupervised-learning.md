# Introduction - Unsupervised learning

> In supervised learning , we generally had training examples 1 -> m and labels associated with training examples ( eg belonging to class 1 (cancer) or 0 (no cancer)). In Unsupervised learning, data given has no labels associated with it, and we want to find some sort of "structure" or understanding of the data.


One such algorithm, which divides the data into **"clusters"** is known as the clustering algorithm

It has a variety of usages such as:
* Market segmentation -> To serve markets particular segments better by understanding their demographics.
* Social N/W analysis -> Coherency amongst a group of people.
* Data center organization ->  On the basis of what works together in a data center in terms of computing power, etc.
* Astronomical data analysis -> Analysis of data about the space.
