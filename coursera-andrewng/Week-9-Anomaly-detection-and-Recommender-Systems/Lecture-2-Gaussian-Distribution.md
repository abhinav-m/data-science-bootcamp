# Gaussian distribution 

If we have a dataset that we think might be related to a normal distribution or a gaussian distribution, we can estimate the value of variance (sigma^2) and mean U for the dataset.

* U is just the average
* Variance ( sigma ^ 2) is the squared difference from the mean for all values ( averaged )
