> Z-score is the value associated with a particular cumulative probability whereas Z* is the Z-score associated with a particular confidence level. If someone asks, what is the Z-score associated with 0.95 or 95% probability, you just have to look up the table and find the corresponding value associated with it. In this case, it would come up as 1.65(or 1.645 to be more exact). However if someone asks you what is the Z* for 95% confidence level, then first you need to find the corresponding cumulative probability associated with that confidence level. This can be easily calculated with the following formula: if y is the confidence level in percentage then the probability is given as y/100 +(1-y/100)/2. Thus for y=95, we have the probability as 95/100+(1-95/100)/2= 0.975. And the Z-score associated with 0.975 probability is 1.96. You can verify the rest of the values given above with this formula.
