  ### Project Ideas 

  * Recommender system based on ingredients - Recipes and restaurants ( BASED on SOM taught in class)
  * Covid Analysis using SOM (impact on economy)
  * Machine learning ( DEEP LEARNING ) using image recognition on ROM data taught in IE-5374 suggested by RK.


  ### Todo:
  1. Read class research papers.
  2. Class pending homework IE-5374
