Dataset, given without structure ( not labeled.)
Given this data, and unknown groups, make it structured.

> Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

Eg classifying news story according to topic into one topic, Clustering genes in different individuals.
Seperating sound in an audio clip

Use cases:
* Organizing computer clusters in data centers( which machines work better together)
* Social media analysis -> Groups of people marked and identified according to demographics
* Market segmentation to sell to different market segments 
* Astronomoical data analysis can give insight to how galaxies are formed.



## Cocktail party problem

> The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. 
> 
Suppose there is a party and a number of people are talking simultaneously.

This could be taken as an unsupervised learning problem, and applying an algorithm could seperate the two audio sources into seperate outputs
