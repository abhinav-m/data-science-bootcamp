Definition
> A computer program is said to learn from an experience E wrt task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on task T, measured by P improves with experience E.

Taking the example of Email spam detection:
* The task at hand **T** is : Detecting the email is spam or not.
* The performance measure **P** is : Ratio of correctly classified spam emails by the program.
* The Experience **E** is : Learning from the number of emails classified by the user as spam.

Summarising, the computer program will learn by observing the user mark the email as spam or non spam.

## Machine learning algorithms:

* Supervised learning - Teach the computer to learn something
* Unsupervised learning - Let the computer learn itself
* Others - Reinforcement learning, recommender systems.

Important to understand how to use these to problems correctly/aptly.
