## SUPERVISED LEARNING

> The right answer has been given to the algorithm. The algorithm trains from the dataset and predicts new answers.

**Regression problem**: gives continous value as output (doubt).
In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function.

Eg Housing market prices given, predict prices on bases of house area.
Based on past data, what will be the stock market value.

**Classification problem**: O or 1, false or true. For eg, Based on tumour size whether tumour is malignant or not.
Based on patient age, whether COVID is fatal or not.
Classification problems can have multiple possibilities as well, eg different types of cancer 1, 2,3, 4

Machine learning algorithms can have multiple features on the basis of which they are trained. For eg, age and tumour size for predicting breast cancer. 

But if number of features are many, **SVMS** ( Support vector machines) come into the picture.
