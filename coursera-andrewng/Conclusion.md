# Conclusion
Things taught in course:

* Supervised Learning: Linear regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVMS (Labelled data) to find out predictions / unlabelled.
* Unsupervised learning: K means algorithm , Principle Component Analysis, Anomaly detection. (Unlabelled data, except in anomaly detection where there is labelled data)
