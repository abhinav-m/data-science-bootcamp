# Linear regression with multiple variables
Notation:
* n  = number of features
* m = number of training examples
* x^i = vector of features in ith training example

**Equation can be understood as transpose of input constants vector multiplied by  feature vectors**

> Linear regression with multiple variables is also known as "multivariate linear regression".
