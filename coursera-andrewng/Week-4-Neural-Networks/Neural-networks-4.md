# Simple examples of neural networks

Neural networks can be used to make simple AND / OR operator with the correct theta values and applying the sigmoid function on them.

Here is an example of the or function.

> If the above function value is modified with -30,20,20 as parameters for X0,X1 and X2, it will be an AND operator.
