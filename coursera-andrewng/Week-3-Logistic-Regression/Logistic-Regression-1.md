# Classification problems

- Email/spam problems
- Online fraudulent transactions
- Tumor Malignant / Benign
- Generally in classification problems, 0 is called the negative class (eg non spam email, 1 is the positive class -> Spam email)

**This can also be a multi class classification problem, more results possible than 0 and 1**

> What if we apply linear regression to a classification problem (say 0 and 1) ? It won't work. Since we get a constant value from hypothesis function which can be much larger than 1 or lesser than 0. Even if we apply a threshhold to classify, this won't be accurate.
